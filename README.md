# arrayfire-example
An example utilization of the arrayfire library. Used in the context of the seminar i'm writing on gpu programming.

You need to have arrayfire installed. In my case I did it from source, although there are
pre-compiled binaries on ubuntu. More info [here](http://arrayfire.org/docs/installing.htm).
